Host those somewhere, pass the URL to the function. See below:\n\n\n## How to use it\n\n```js\n\nvar string = 'a string containing emoji strings like :heart: and :trollface:';\n\n// the emoji function takes:\n// 1. The input string\n// 2. The url where the png files live\n// 3. (optionally) a size to specify as the height of the <img> tag.\nvar emojified = emoji(string, 'http://url.com/where-you-put-the-pngs-folder/', 30); \n\n```\n\nIt's bundled to work as a CommonJS module, AMD module or expose itself as a global as a fallback.\n\n## install\n\nGrab it here or on npm:\n\n```\nnpm install emoji-images\n```\n\n## Why not just use https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js?\n\nI want it all in a super simple text processing (without the CSS and DOM stuff).\n\nAlso, that solution embeds pngs as data-uri's in css documents. I don't want to do that because then I have to send all that image data to the browser even if they never get used.\n\n\n## Is it ready to use?\n\nUm... works for me™  (and in use on andbang.com)\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
